## Engine registry

- Python entrypoint group: `ash_nazg.engines`
- Each entrypoint resolves to a class implementing the `Engine`
  Protocol from `host/src/ash_nazg/engines/__init__.py`.
- Discovery happens once at host startup. Failures (missing
  attributes, raised exceptions) are logged and the engine is
  skipped — host stays up.
- Admin settings can disable individual engines; the registry
  filters disabled engines out of dispatch.

## AppAPI 5.x manual-install — finding from the test-target migration

The test-target migration to NC 32 + AppAPI 5.x (task §4c) ran the
existing `verify-against-nextcloud.sh` against the new target and
surfaced a real architectural constraint that flips the assumption
this design.md was originally written under.

### What we believed (in the proposal)

> *"AppAPI 5.x ships a real registration handshake where the
> ExApp advertises its listen port (and routes, scopes, etc.) back
> to AppAPI."*

### What AppAPI 5.x actually does

In `manual-install` mode AppAPI **always auto-allocates** the
ExApp port (~23000 in our test). After `app_api:app:register`
returns, AppAPI synchronously heartbeat-checks the ExApp at
`<daemon-host or inferred>:<allocated-port>`. The check fails
loudly when nothing is listening there, but neither the
`--info-xml` block, nor the `<port>` field of `info.xml`, nor the
`--env APP_PORT=...` flag, nor a `host: null` daemon, persuade
AppAPI to use a different port.

Verified with two daemon variants:

| Daemon `host` | Result |
|---|---|
| `ash-nazg-host` (compose DNS) | Register hangs / times out polling `ash-nazg-host:23000` |
| `null` (per AppAPI's own `--help` example) | Same: register completes with `"Heartbeat check failed"`; ExApp registered but disabled |

`oc_ex_apps.port = 23000` in both cases. `oc_ex_apps_routes`
remains empty until the ExApp registers its routes via a separate
runtime call — which it can only do once it's reachable, i.e.
listening on the right port. Chicken and egg.

### Implication for the handshake design

The flow has to be:

```
1. ExApp container starts (without knowing its assigned port).
2. occ app_api:app:register …  →  AppAPI allocates port (e.g. 23000)
                                  AppAPI also generates APP_SECRET
                                  AppAPI heartbeats ExApp:23000  ⤺ fails
3. The driver (bootstrap script or docker-install daemon) reads
   the allocated port + secret from AppAPI and (re)starts the
   ExApp container with APP_PORT and APP_SECRET set accordingly.
4. ExApp comes back up listening on the allocated port; subsequent
   heartbeats succeed; AppAPI marks the ExApp healthy.
5. ExApp now POSTs its routes to AppAPI (separate runtime call).
6. AppAPI proxy URLs start working.
```

For a `docker-install` daemon (HaRP, DSP), AppAPI itself spawns
the container with the right env vars in step 3 — there's no chicken-
and-egg.

For `manual-install`, the operator runs the container, so steps
3–5 require either:

- **a) Two-pass deploy:** register first to get the port, then
  start the container with `APP_PORT=<that>`. Awkward in a
  docker-compose-up world where the container is already running.
- **b) Reverse-proxy shim:** the host container listens on a fixed
  port (8080) and a tiny in-container reverse proxy forwards from
  the AppAPI-allocated port to 8080. Adds complexity but keeps
  compose simple.
- **c) Move to docker-install with HaRP:** the v1-canonical path.
  Requires bringing up HaRP daemon + docker socket, but eliminates
  the port-juggling entirely.

### Decision: (c) — docker-install via HaRP, for both production and level-3

Three options were on the table:

- **(a)** Two-pass manual-install deploy.
- **(b)** In-container port-shim.
- **(c)** docker-install via HaRP.

Decision: **(c) for both paths**. Rationale:

- **One install model is cheaper than two.** Maintaining
  manual-install "just for level-3" creates a dialect that
  drifts from production. The pain of "works in prod, fails in
  level-3" or vice-versa six months in is larger than the
  upfront cost of running HaRP locally.
- **Manual-install is second-rate in AppAPI 5.x.** AppAPI's own
  CLI examples list manual-install last, with `host: null` and
  caveats. The contributors clearly treat docker-install as the
  primary path. We follow the upstream's centre of gravity.
- **The "refactor bomb" risk dominates.** Building wiring code
  on top of a manual-install handshake assumption that we'd
  later have to rework for App Store submission is precisely
  the kind of mid-flight architectural rework spec-driven
  development is meant to prevent.

What this means concretely for `wire-dosbox-engine`:

- The level-3 verifier's compose stack adds an `appapi-harp`
  service. The ash-nazg-host service is no longer started by
  compose — HaRP spawns it via the docker socket on `app:register`.
- The host shim's `appapi.register()` reads `APP_PORT`,
  `APP_SECRET`, `APP_VERSION`, `APP_ID`, `NEXTCLOUD_URL` from env
  vars that **HaRP sets when it spawns the container** (per the
  AppAPI 5.x docker-install convention) and accepts those values
  rather than choosing them.
- Routes are POSTed to AppAPI by the ExApp at startup as the
  second part of the handshake (this part of the original design
  is unchanged — it's the route registration that's still the
  ExApp's responsibility, not the port).

The acceptance criterion *"no DB UPDATE workaround in the
bootstrap"* stays — and now there's no bootstrap-driven port
patching at all, because HaRP handles port allocation directly.

## AppAPI registration handshake (AppAPI 5.x)

Triggered at host startup (FastAPI `lifespan` hook). One handshake
call from the ExApp to AppAPI, replacing several pieces of
post-install hand-holding that 4.0.6 needed.

**Endpoint.** `POST {NEXTCLOUD_URL}/index.php/apps/app_api/api/v1/exapp/register`

**Payload (canonical fields, names per AppAPI 5.x):**

| Field | Purpose | Why we need it |
|---|---|---|
| `appid` | `ash_nazg` | Identity |
| `version` | host shim's version | Matches `<version>` in info.xml |
| `secret` | per-deploy shared secret | AppAPI uses it to sign callbacks back to the ExApp |
| `host` | the host shim's address from AppAPI's POV | For our manual-install model: `ash-nazg-host` (compose DNS name) |
| `port` | what the host shim is **actually** listening on | **Replaces the 4.0.6 DB-poke workaround.** AppAPI stores this verbatim in `oc_ex_apps.port`; no auto-allocation, no UPDATE. |
| `routes` | every URL path the AppAPI proxy may forward | Populates `oc_ex_apps_routes`. Without this the proxy 404s — that was the gap in the level-3 verifier under 4.0.6. |
| `scopes` | requested AppAPI scopes (must match info.xml) | `FILES`, `AUDIT_LOGS`, `NOTIFICATIONS` |
| `external` | true | We're not a docker-install ExApp |

**Behaviour.**

- On `200 OK` from AppAPI → host enters serving state, starts
  accepting `/run` requests.
- On `4xx/5xx` → log the AppAPI response body (helpful for
  diagnosing a misconfigured manifest), retry with exponential
  backoff (5 s, 15 s, 45 s, …) up to 5 minutes, then exit
  non-zero. The compose `restart: unless-stopped` policy (or
  HaRP, in non-manual-install deployments) brings the container
  back.
- On network unreachable (NC not yet up) → same backoff, but the
  error log distinguishes "could not reach AppAPI" from "AppAPI
  rejected our payload" so the operator sees the right thing.

**What this retires from the scaffold.**

- `bootstrap-nextcloud.sh`'s `oc_ex_apps.port` UPDATE — gone, the
  handshake sets the right port directly.
- The "AppAPI proxy 404 by design" caveat in
  `docs/testing.md` — once routes register, the proxy works.
- The placeholder `register()` in `host/src/ash_nazg/appapi.py`
  raising `NotImplementedError`.

**Acceptance signal.** After this lands, deleting the SQL UPDATE
from `bootstrap-nextcloud.sh` and re-running
`scripts/verify-against-nextcloud.sh` produces a working install.
That's the boring-and-verifiable definition of "the handshake is
the source of truth, not the workaround".

## Decision: the engine ships in the host image

**Context.** `POST /spawn (image, env, limits)` in the sequence above
assumed the deploy daemon offers ExApps a way to start a container. It
does not. Measured on NC 32.0.14 + AppAPI 5.x + HaRP v0.4.0:

- An ExApp container has no docker CLI and no socket. The
  `DockerSubprocessSpawner` reported it plainly — `docker binary not
  found on PATH` — which is how this surfaced.
- HaRP's docker-engine backend is for AppAPI, not for ExApps. With the
  shared key an ExApp gets past authentication (401 becomes 404), but
  every docker path answers 404. There is no sanctioned spawn surface.

**Options.** (a) the engine ships in the ExApp image; (b) require a
docker socket to be mounted into the ExApp; (c) each engine becomes its
own ExApp that AppAPI deploys.

**Decision: (a), for the MVP.** (b) asks an administrator for exactly
the privilege an App Store reviewer looks for, and rules out managed
installs. (c) is where container-level isolation comes back and is the
direction once there is more than one engine, but it makes every engine
a separate App Store item with its own lifecycle — too much for the
first release.

**What it costs, precisely.** A session is a process tree, not a
container, so: no cgroup CPU/memory limits, the root filesystem is not
read-only, and the emulator runs under the shim's uid — it can read the
shim's environment, `APP_SECRET` included. What remains is the emulator
itself: the untrusted binary is a DOS program inside DOSBox-X, never
native code on the container's CPU. That is a real boundary, and it is
the one this design leans on. The `sandbox` and `engines` spec deltas
say so in those words rather than restating the container promise.

**What is enforced instead.** A private 0700 directory per session
holding only the binary (downloaded, not mounted — so no davfs2 and no
mount privileges); a cap on concurrent sessions; a scheduling priority
below the shim's; a maximum session duration; termination on close and
on host shutdown; and release of the (user, file) claim on every one of
those paths, so a closed session can be started again.

## Self-test wiring

Each of the four checks gets a real implementation, while the
JSON shape stays identical:

| id                     | implementation                                                                                  |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `host-health`          | `httpx.get('http://127.0.0.1:8080/health')` from inside the host container; status==200.       |
| `engines-registered`   | `len([e for e in registry.enabled_engines()]) >= 1`.                                            |
| `engine-runtime`  | The spawner's preflight: `dosbox-x` and `kasmvncserver` are on PATH, the engine entrypoint is executable, and a session slot is free. |
| `audit-log-write`      | Write an `event: ash_nazg.selftest` entry; assert the AppAPI audit-log API returned 2xx.        |

## Boring valkuil

1. **Custom websocket proxy.** Tempting to write a tiny FastAPI
   websocket relay because "KasmVNC is overkill for DOSBox-X." Don't.
   The streaming-proxy change uses KasmVNC; bypassing creates
   throwaway code that streaming-proxy then deletes.
2. **Skipping the engine entrypoint's WebDAV mount and using
   `docker cp`.** Deceptively simpler, but breaks the "save
   inside the app, see it in Files immediately" UX. Pick davfs2
   from day one.
3. **Hardcoding `engine == 'dosbox-x'` in the dispatcher.** The
   plugin protocol exists exactly so v2 engines slot in without
   touching dispatch. Resist any shortcut that bakes the engine
   name into the dispatcher.
